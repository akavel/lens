# Lens

**eLife Lens** provides a novel way of looking at content on the web. It is designed to make life easier for researchers, reviewers, authors and readers. For example, have you tried to look at a figure in an online article, while at the same time trying to see what the author says about the figure, jumping all around the article, losing track of what you were looking for in the first place? The reason for this is that most online research articles are published in a fixed digital version of the original paper. With eLife Lens, we take full advantage of the internetâ€™s flexibility.

# Install

Installing and running Lens locally is quite simple, since all you need is a web-browser.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/elifesciences/lens.git
$ cd lens
$ open index.html
```

# Rough plans for this summer

We'll turn this into a roadmap soon.

- Integrating other OA content (first will be [PLOS](http://www.plos.org))
- Private notes, so users can stick notes on their paper which are stored locally
- Evaluating options for offline reading
- And obviously there will be bugfixes, UI polish addressing the feedback we've got
